## Art Style
8 bit style with cute Tiny. Might be worth looking into higher bit art for Big to differentiate.

## Game Roadmap
### MVP
- Tiny's world (outside frame) IN PROGRESS, needs art fleshed out. Walls (kettle and stove, speaker, plant, panels), Tiny.
- -Screen for Big's world (basic animation of walking)- DONE
- -Figure out how to show Rhythm buttons/beats- DONE
- -Also implement basic 4/4 rhythm game- DONE

### Additional Features:
- Different stages for Big/different life happenings (basically different rhythm levels) - IN PROGRESS
- -Always ends the stage by going to sleep (level transition)- Change to stops running. Works!
- Animations for Tiny doing things - 4 frames that switch randomly between hitting beats. Bonus - frame when the game ends that turns off the kettle, and has Tiny with a cup of tea/wiping sweat from brow.
- Add lampost to the Big world. Faster than background.
- Add animations/ words that pop up when you hit a note.
- Add instructions for the game to main screen/ polish main screen in general.

### Stretch Goals:
- Tiny having extra downtime/cute activities (watering plants, sleeping, fishing, etc)
- Switch keys for bonus? Do two activities at once?
- Add a fuck-ton of polish (animation/art, rhythm game)
