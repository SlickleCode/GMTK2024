## Art Style
8 bit style with cute Tiny. Might be worth looking into higher bit art for Big to differentiate.

## Game Roadmap
### MVP
- Tiny's world (outside frame)
- Screen for Big's world (basic animation of walking)
- Figure out how to show Rhythm buttons/beats
- Also implement basic 4/4 rhythm game

### Additional Features:
- Different stages for Big/different life happenings (basically different rhythm levels)
 - Always ends the stage by going to sleep (level transition)
- Animations for Tiny doing things

### Stretch Goals:
- Tiny having downtime/cute activities (watering plants, sleeping, fishing, etc)
- Switch keys for bonus? Do two activities at once?
- Add a fuck-ton of polish (animation/art, rhythm game)
